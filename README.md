Mysh is a Python-based interactive shell built from scratch. It supports command execution, tab completion, pipelines, and persistent command history, offering a simplified shell experience with features similar to traditional Unix shells.

  - Executables in `PATH`
  - Longest common prefix completion
  - Multi-match and bell notification handling
- 🧵 Pipelines:
  - Dual and multi-command pipelines
  - Support for built-ins in pipelines
- 🧠 Command history:
  - View with `history`
  - Limit output using `history <n>`
  - Load from file: `history -r <file>`
  - Write to file: `history -w <file>`
  - Append new entries: `history -a <file>`
  - Auto load/save using the `HISTFILE` environment variable

- `history`
- `exit 0`

## 📁 Files
